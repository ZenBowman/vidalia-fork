         Building the Vidalia/Tor/Polipo/Torbutton Bundle


1. Create a base directory under which the necessary sources will be extracted
and place vidalia-bundle.nsi and all language-specific .nsh files in it. For 
this example, we will just use C:\bundle\.
      
       C:\bundle\vidalia-bundle.nsi
       C:\bundle\vidalia_en.nsh
       [...]
       C:\bundle\vidalia_ru.sh
                 

2. Create directories for each component in the bundle.

        C:\bundle\polipo\
        C:\bundle\tor\
        C:\bundle\vidalia\
        C:\bundle\torbutton\

3. Modify the appropriate version values (VIDALIA_APPVERSION, TOR_APPVERSION,
POLIPO_APPVERSION, and TORBUTTON_APPVERSION) at the top of vidalia-bundle.nsi.

4. Create directories for the appropriate versions of each component.

        C:\bundle\polipo\1.0.4\
        C:\bundle\tor\0.2.1.19\
        C:\bundle\vidalia\0.2.3\
        C:\bundle\torbutton\1.2.2\

5. Install Vidalia, Tor, and Polipo to the directories you created for them
in Step 4. Remember that you may need to grab the torrc.sample file from
%APPDATA%\Tor that was created by Tor's installer and place it in the directory
for the bundle's version of Tor. You may also need to grab
%APPDATA%\Vidalia\geoip-cache, or a geoip-cache from Vidalia's source
repository, and place it in the directory for the bundle's version of
Vidalia.

6. Place the Torbutton Firefox extension (.xpi) and license file (LICENSE) in
the directory you created for it in Step 4.

7. Place the polipo.conf into the polipo directory you created in Step 4.

8. Run the vidalia-bundle.nsi script. The bundle will be named according the
the versions you specified in Step 4 and placed in the base directory created
in Step 1.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For each additional release of some component of the bundle, follow Steps 4-8.
If the version of some component didn't change, you can skip its step. For
example, if the version of polipo didn't change then you can skip Step 7.
